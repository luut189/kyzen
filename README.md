# Kyzen - 2D LWJGL-based Game Engine

This is a lightweight **2D game engine** built using **LWJGL** (Lightweight Java Game Library) with OpenGL bindings for graphics, designed for creating 2D games.

The engine supports basic components like rendering, scenes, input handling, asset management, and an **Entity-Component System (ECS)**.

## Features

- **Batch Rendering**: Efficient rendering of multiple objects in a single batch.
- **Entity-Component System (ECS)**: Easily extendable architecture where game objects are built using components.
- **Texture Atlas Support**: Efficient texture management for sprites and tiles.
- **Basic Input Handling**: Support for keyboard and mouse input.
- **Lighting System**: Initial implementation of lighting for 2D games.
- **Scene Management**: Handle different game scenes, like menus, levels, and pause screens.

## Requirements

- Java 17+ (or the required version for LWJGL)
- Maven (If you want to use Gradle, you have to reconfigure the project's dependencies yourself)
